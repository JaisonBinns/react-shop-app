This is my shop app.

# RUNNING LOCALLY

To get started:

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Make dev.js file inside config folder
3. Add mongoDB URL info into dev.js file
4. Type " npm install " inside the root directory ( Download Server Dependencies )

6. Type "npm run dev" to run the app locally. The server will run on port 5000. The client will run on port 3000. The port can be changed in ./server/index.js.

The client site will be available at http://localhost:3000/

7. Create an account to upload products.
8. If the Paypal button is not available, you may need to create a paypal developer account for a sandbox ID. More info available: https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts
